BEST CASE : K=5 T=0.5 Alpha = 0.3
CASE 1 : K=3 T=0.5 Alpha = 0.9 NewSigma = 1 (better back ground substraction but noise in foreground)
CASE 2 : K=3 T=0.9 Alpha = 0.9 NewSigma = 1 (better back ground substraction but noise in foreground)\
CASE 3 : K=3 T=0.9 Alpha = 0.3 NewSigma = 1 (better back ground substraction)(better foreground) close to BEST case
CASE 4 : K=3 T=0.7 Alpha = 0.1 NewSigma = 1(not so good back ground substraction and foreground)
CASE 5 : K=5 T=0.7 Alpha = 0.3 NewSigma = 10 NewWeight = 0.05(no back ground substraction)
CASE 6 : K=3 T=0.5 Alpha = 0.3 NewSigma = 10 NewWeight = 0.05(no back ground substraction)





Procedure:
1. RGB frame is converted to gray so as to fit 1D gaussian
2. Means are randomly initialized with values taken from frames at different intervals of video
3. Sigmas values are less due to the fact that background values tend to have less variance and same was observed while looking at the gray pixel values for frames
4. Values of a particular pixel location for all frames is modelled as a mixture of adaptive guassians.
5. Variation in values of a particular pixel over time gives rise to different scenarios which fits different guassians.
6. Not much variation in lighting conditions in the video
7. pixel at time t is modelled as P(Xt) = summation from 1 to no of gaussians * priors * N(X(t-1) |mu , sigma )
8. Each pixel value is within 2.5*sigma of the ditribution then its a match
9. We update the mean,sigma and weights accordingly
10. If no match is there we replace the least probable(least (weight/sigma) value) distribution with a new distribution
11. Distributions are then ordered in descending order of (weight/sigma) and first B guassians whose cumulative value is > T are considered as background gaussians 
12.if a pixel matches first B gaussians then its considered as background else its considered as foreground.


Learning/Inferences:
1. Initialization of means was the biggest problem and the performance of the algorithm is directly proportional with the mean initialization
2. The algorithm is time consuming
3. If K is large the algorithm adapts better to the changes but time increases 
4. greater is the T greater is the proportion of the background
5. Alpha value should be a bit large so as to separate the matching gaussians from the unmatched ones.
